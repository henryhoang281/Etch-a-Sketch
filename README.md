# Etch-a-Sketch

Description: making sketch pad which can be drawn either in black or multiple color, erased or reset the whole pad in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

What I have learnt while doing this project: 
addEventListener()
Grid
forEach()
for()
Flex-box 
DOM

How I did: 
1. Draw a lay-out of sketch pad in HTML with a title, a board and buttons
2. Using JavaScript to draw a board 32x32 filled with small squares inside using grid and for loop
3. Make a function that every time you move your mouse over the square it changes color and add that function to the board
4. Make another function that reset the board back to default color = white
5. Make another function that every time you click, you keep drawing, click again, stop drawing(not apply when click on buttons)
6. Add onclick event to each button design to its color in HTML
7. Style it
